# Chess Bot

Project for the exam of Deep Neural Networks, the aim is to create a Chess Bot using Reinforcement Learning.

There are many file that do not concern reinforcement learning, since many different approaches are (going to be) explored, in order to understand the efficiency of the bot.

Work in progress :)
